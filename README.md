# Similarity of Faces
I used ClarifAi's Face Embedding model to find out which one of my parents I am visually similar to.

I used one image which had my dad on the left and my mom to the right.

## Usage
Works on Python 3.5
The python file accepts the location of your image as a command line argument.
For example: `python3 faceEmbed.py dad_me_mom.jpg`
